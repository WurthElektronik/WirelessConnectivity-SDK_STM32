### **Create certificates**

In order to securely connect the device to IoT central application, the device needs to implement certain method for authentication. In this case, the X.509 certificate based authentication is implemented. This method requires creation of certificates for every device. In order to enable easy prototyping, Würth Elektronik eiSos’s Certificate creation tool can be used. This tool creates all the certificates necessary to get started.

- Download the WE certificate generator tool from https://www.we-online.com/certificategenerator 

 - Unzip to a suitable location on the computer and open the executable "WECertificateUploader.exe"

Inside the WE Certificate Generator tool, fill in the Device ID to generate the required certificates for the cloud service. The Device ID is the name of the device as it appears in the IoT central APP. It needs to be unique per device. 

#### **Device root certificate:**
This is the self-signed certificate that acts as the root of trust for all devices. The device root certificate is used to generate leaf certificates. Each device has a unique leaf certificate that identifies the device. The root certificate can be generated once and used for generating leaf certificates for several devices. The WE certificate uploader tool allows creation of a new root certificate, saving the same and loading it back for subsequent usage. 

![Device Root Certificate](figure/deviceroot.png)

1. On first time use, set the validity time in month. For example, 1 month.

2. Click on "Create root certificate" to create a new root certificate. 

3. [**Optional**] If a root certificate already exists, click on "Load root certificate". This opens a file browser. Browse to the correct location to choose the previously used root certificate. Use .pfx format certificate for loading.
  
4. [**Optional**]  Click on "Save root certificate" to save the generated root certificate for future use. This can be used generate the certificate in .pfx format which is the format  used during loading a certificate.

5. [**Optional**]  Click on "Export root PEM" to export the certificate in PEM format. This file needs to be uploaded to the IoT central application

6. [**Optional**]  Click on "Display root certificate" to view the certificate in the standard Windows format.
  
#### **Device certificate:**
Every device requires a unique device certificate to securely connect to the IoT central application. Each device certificate generated is exclusively linked to the device through the device ID and cannot be used on any other device.

![Device Certificate](figure/devicecert.png)

1. For every device ID, set the validity time in months. For example, 1 month.
2. Click on "Create device certificate" to create a new device certificate
3. [**Optional**] Click on "Export device PEM" to export the certificate in PEM format. This file needs to be uploaded to the device.  
4. [**Optional**] Click on "Display device certificate" to view the certificate in the standard Windows format.



#### **Device private key:**

![Device Key](figure/devicekey.png) 

This is the private key corresponding to the public key in the device certificate and is also uniquely linked to a device ID. Click on "Export device private key" to export the key in PEM format. This file needs to be uploaded to the device as will be explained in the subsequent sections.

![Certificate Generator Tool Steps](figure/certgenstep.PNG)
   
After completing the process of generating the root and device certificates, export all the files by clicking "Export All Files". The SSID, SSID Password, Security, NTP Server and Timezone parameters are not required, which result in no configuration file being generated.

### **Upload the Root certificate to IoT central**
    
In this step, the device root certificate is uploaded to IoT central and a policy is set to allow all devices with leaf certificate that are generated from this root to connect to the platform.

If an organization does not exist, create an organization as described in this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/howto-create-organizations).
    
![Create New Profile](figure/createNewProfile.png)
  
  - In the IoT central app open, "Permissions > Device connection groups" and click on "+New"
  
![Create_Enrollment Group](figure/create_enrollmentgroup.PNG)

  - In the subsequent window,
    * a. Enter a name for the enrollment group.
    * b. Set the "Automatically connect devices in this group" to "On".
    * c. Set the group type to "IoT devices"  
    * d. Set the attestation type to "Certificates (X.509)"
    * e. Click on "Save".
    

![Manage Certificate](figure/managecert.png)
- Once the enrollment group is created, the root certificate needs to be added to this group.
In order to do this,
  * a. Click on "Manage primary" in the "Certificates (X.509)" section of the enrollment group.
  * b. In the pop-up window, click on "Add certificate" and select the device root file generated using the WE certificate generator.
  * c. Set the "Set certificate status to verified on upload" option to "On".
  * d. Click on "Upload"
  * e. On completion of the upload process, close the pop-up window.

### **Hardware Setup**

There are two main steps while connecting the STM32 Nucleo board to the Calypso Evaluation Board. The two connection types, which are the power connection to the Calypso Evaluation board and the UART connections through jumper cables from the STM32 Nucleo board need to be setup.

#### **Power to Calypso evaluation board:**

From the STM32 Nucleo board, connect the power pins of 3V3 and GND to the Calypso evaluation board's connector 9 or connector 4 (pins 1 & 4) 
More information on the connector pins of the Calypso Evaluation Board can be found at :

```

### **Software Setup**

          
The Wi-Fi module needs to be configured through the software platform with certain parameters to connect to the desired Wi-Fi network and previously created IoT central application. Download the required files from github and open them on STM32 Cube IDE

:warning: Make sure that the Calypso FeatherWing has a Firmware version > v2.2.0. In case of older firmware version, update the Calypso module Firmware.
   
The following changes need to be done on the Calypso_Azure_PnP_Example.h file

a. CALYPSO_AZURE_PNP_WLAN_SSID -> Define this with the desired Wi-Fi SSID to connect
   
b. CALYPSO_AZURE_PNP_WLAN_PW -> Define this with the password of the Wi-Fi to connect
  
c. CALYPSO_AZURE_PNP_DEVICE_ID -> Define this with the name of the device as it appears in the IoT central Application. It needs to be unique per device.
   
d. SCOPE_ID -> Define this with the scope noted from the previous section. scope ID is unique per application but common across devices.
   
The following certificates need to be updated in the same header file by copying the respective certificates generated from the WE Certificate Generator tool. Note that "\r\n\" needs to be added after every 64 characters and after " "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and before "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" of the certificate files.
   
e. DIGICERT_GLOBAL_G2_ROOT_CERT -> Define this with the Device root certificate generated from the WE Certificate Generator Tool.
   
f. DEVICE_CERT -> Define this with the Device certificate generated from the WE Certificate Generator Tool
   
g. DEVICE_KEY -> Define this with the Device private key generated from the WE Certificate Generator Tool
   
![Config change](figure/config_change.PNG)
   

After performing the changes, build the project and run. The module should then be configured to connect to Azure.
     
If the certificate files needs to be overwritten, comment out the lines 175 - 180 in Calypso_Azure_PnP_Example.c
     
```
if((false == Calypso_Azure_PnP_File_Exists(ROOT_CA_PATH)) || (false == Calypso_Azure_PnP_File_Exists(DEVICE_CERT_PATH)) ||
			(false == Calypso_Azure_PnP_File_Exists(DEVICE_KEY_PATH)))
	{
		/*(One time only) Write the certificates to the file system*/
		Calypso_Azure_PnP_Write_Certs();
	}
```
